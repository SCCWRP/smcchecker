# SMC Data Checker

The SCCWRP Flask app data checker which now uses more optimized code to check, which should allow for faster data checking. 
This repository is based on the template repository "checker2.0" which is simply a refactoring of the original Checker app

The reason why this checker is receiving its own repository is because the SMC data requires customization which is very project specific and would not apply to any other projects. Specifically the PHAB, Algae (ASCI) and BMI Taxonomy (CSCI) routines.
