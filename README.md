# Data Checker

The SCCWRP Flask app data checker which now uses more optimized code to check, which should allow for faster data checking. 
This repository is more or less a template to set up checker applications for different projects. 

There is a separate private repository called geodb_setup where we have tools for setting up the backend database. 

Some of those python scripts can potentially be moved here, since they are not necessarily part of any application but rather they are ran through Arc Catalog or Arc Pro. We'll have to think about whether we want to store those separately or in here.
